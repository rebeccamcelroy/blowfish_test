      <description>Hello!
I am a Research Fellow in the Centre for Astrophysics at the University of Southern Queensland in Brisbane, Australia. I work on integral field spectroscopic data, in particular using the MUSE instrument on the VLT. The Close AGN Reference Survey looks at local active galaxies across the electromagnetic spectrum and I also work with the galaxy merger simulations to study how galaxy kinematics evolve as galaxies collide.
Previously, I was at the University of Queensland, the Sydney Institute for Astronomy in the School of Physics at the University of Sydney, and the Max Plank Institute for Astronomy in Heidelberg, Germany.</description>

      <description>Art has been a lifelong hobby of mine. I have always loved to draw and paint, and recently I have been experimenting with digital art. On my instagram I primarily post art based on TV and video games, with a focus on portraiture. Feel free to DM me if you would commission a portrait of your favourite character!
On this site you can also find my science illustration scribbles, which are free for you to use with attribution.</description>
